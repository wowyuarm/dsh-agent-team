/**
 * Producer-attributed message sources for Agent Team context management.
 *
 * Both sources ride ordinary `UserMessage`s under this plugin's own
 * producer kind with the `snapshot` context form — Session format V4 admits
 * exactly that shape and refuses the retired `{ kind: 'plugin', plugin: … }`
 * wrapper at write time. See `docs/dsh-release-compatibility.md`
 * § "Session message sources".
 *
 * Everything the Host needs to read back therefore rides the admitted payload
 * slots: the handoff envelope and the checkpoint correlation both travel as
 * named {@link ContextSnapshotSection} contributions, distinguished by their
 * stable section names. Sections are the format's designed slot for structured
 * producer payload, and they render as named contributions on any
 * snapshot-aware surface.
 *
 * The validators below are the single place that recognizes these messages, so
 * callers never match on localized body text. Writing them belongs to the
 * context-continuity engine's codec, which Team constructs with its own plugin
 * identity and prose (`context-continuity-host.ts`): one writer, so the
 * envelope Team reads back can never drift from the one it wrote.
