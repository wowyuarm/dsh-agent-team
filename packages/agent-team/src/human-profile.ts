 * handle shown in team_view, @ matching, and UI follows this profile.
 *
 * Storage split (see spec.md v1):
 * - name + avatarRef are the Team Host row's own Config, so they live in the
 *   active profile's patch document as that row's `config` and the settings
 *   service derives their form from this schema. rc.1 derives every form from
 *   a plugin's Config, so the retired `installSection` namespace — a section of
 *   its own — has no counterpart; the row id below is the settings namespace.
 * - avatar bytes live under a persistent directory below; the profile holds
 *   only the reference, never a data URL. The composer attachment cache is
 *   TTL-bound and must not hold avatar bytes.
 *
 * The legacy-section adoption below is transitional: it exists for installs
 * upgraded from a pre-rc.1 profile document, and retires — with
 * `LEGACY_HUMAN_PROFILE_SECTION`, `parseLegacyHumanProfile`, and
 * `planLegacyAdoption` — once such installs are no longer supported. Nothing
 * else in the Host reads that document.
