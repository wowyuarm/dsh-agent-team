# @wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The Host capability for one Agent Team in a dshHome. `ctx.agentTeam` owns the append-only operation ledger, reconstructs the current collaboration projection, and is the lifecycle owner for member Agents managed by the same capability. Thread Attention and the Member Inbox are durable Host projections. When unread state changes, this package sends one bounded, coalesced context notification through the Agent's public safe-boundary API; it never interrupts an active request or acts as a Session delivery worker. The [Agent Team architecture note](../../../.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-08-15-agent-team-operation-ledger.md) owns the persistence and package-topology decisions.

## Service contract

The Service consumes `ctx.storageDomain`, `ctx.workspaceRegistry`, `ctx.agents`, `ctx.agentDefaultModel`, `ctx.agentPresets`, `ctx.tools`, `ctx.sessions`, and `ctx.sessionPersistence`. It opens the versioned `agent_team` Domain before Cordis publishes `ctx.agentTeam`. The first boot appends one `team/initialized` operation for the stable Human Member; later boots replay the same operation and do not append another record.

`status()` returns the current durable sequence, operation count, channel count, Agent Member count, and Human Member ref. It performs no model request and no storage write. `validateLedger()` checks the package-owned projection against the durable operation table.

Every operation record carries a positive global sequence, unique operation and request ids, an actor snapshot, and the previous operation id. Replay rejects invalid record fields, table-key/id mismatches, sequence gaps, broken previous links, repeated ids, and invalid state transitions. An identical request-id retry returns the original receipt; a changed payload with the same request id rejects.

## Durability and lifecycle

`storage-domain` validates every record at the durable read boundary and rejects a backend unit stamped with another version. The Team updates its projection only after `KvTable.put()` resolves. Its Fiber owns the Domain handle; disposal rejects new Service calls through Cordis removal, drains accepted Domain writes, and closes the backend unit before the name can reopen.

Member creation commits one stable Member/session/Workspace/preset/private-memory identity before unpublished Agent setup. Setup mounts the selected preset and validates its marked `team_message` plus all five Team tools before publication. Failure leaves only that Member unavailable. Suspend waits for the owned `AgentHandle` to stop; resume and Host remount restore the exact persisted session.

Members optionally carry durable capability intent (`capabilities.tools.allow`, `capabilities.skills.allow`). It flows verbatim through every lifecycle operation, replays unchanged after Host restart, and commits without known-name validation so Harness upgrades can never break old ledgers; divergence from known names surfaces at activation as derived, non-persisted `capabilityWarnings`. `tools.allow` is a deliberate interface reservation (no UI write path today) that future Runtime Revision manifest orchestration depends on. Edits follow absent-clears semantics like `model`: a caller that does not manage capabilities must echo the stored value back or its edit clears the override.

Activation applies `tools.allow` as a scoped restriction over the composed preset surface (mount → restrict → validate) with the five Team tools force-unioned over the configured list; unknown names drop with a warning rather than failing the Member. A live allow-list edit swaps the restriction at a turn boundary in the same Session — idle Members apply immediately, and an edit racing a running turn waits for it while later lifecycle operations queue behind the wait. Restriction failures isolate to that Member's activation diagnostic.

Skills are Member-private: the preset has no shared skill-filesystem row, and the Host registers one provider per Member that scans only that Member's `skills/` directory under its private memory path (default roots excluded, catalog empty until the Member installs a skill itself — self-install via SKILL.md is the only path). `skills.allow` filters the catalog through a live selection ref swapped at the same turn boundary; the filesystem watcher feeds discovery after a self-install.

Every team-managed session records `danger-full-access`. Project cwd remains the Workspace path, while private memory lives under `$DSH_HOME/agent-team/members/<memberId>/`. An untitled Member session is named with its handle through the session-title service, so the ordinary Session list shows the Member identity; an explicit rename or any earlier title always wins. The isolated `team-member` preset also provides coding tools including model-facing web search, Workspace instruction discovery, and Team protocol guidance. The host owns the shared Web service and provider; the preset mounts only the model-facing web tool. Its lowercase `memory.md` is a bounded 8 KiB reference index, injected only for that Member when its content changes; `notes/` stays on-demand through filesystem tools. Over-budget indexes receive a maintenance warning, not silent truncation. Ordinary sessions and forks receive no Team identity or private-memory context. At Host startup the Host prunes `member:`-shaped private-memory directories that the replayed ledger does not reference — leftovers from discarded ledgers, since a version-bumped medium rejects at open and starts empty. Prune failures fail startup; entries outside the `member:` shape are left untouched.

Adding a Member to a Channel grants future read/send/claim authority but injects no historical Messages into the member session. Every top-level Message creates a Thread; new Client/tool starts explicitly choose taskless while released-client omission remains taskful, and a Human can later promote a taskless Thread by atomically adding its Task overlay and a structured `promote` Task activity. Thread Attention starts when a Thread is created, a Claim is created, a member follows, a top-level Message mentions them, or a Human confirms an invitation. Ordinary unread is derived from Attention; structured mentions create durable direct markers, while terminal Task changes retain sparse Activity markers for affected followers after Attention ends. `team_inbox` and Thread reads are Host projections, not Session inbox contents. A direct mention context includes its Message body and source; Task/Claim changes — including promotion — include concise transition facts; ordinary unread carries a body-free Thread-first route. Pending hints are coalesced, ignored hints do not loop, and resume/error recovery derives a new hint from durable unread state. For recoverable service failures, the Host wakes a Member after each of the first two consecutive `agent/error` occurrences, then leaves the third failure for the operator; only a clean turn resets that run.

Member replies require the exact current Thread revision and atomically update Message and Thread facts. `threadRef` is the primary collaboration identity; released task-only Clients may send a Host-resolved `taskRef` alias for taskful Threads, while Task/Claim operations remain Task-ref based. Unread work must be read before a mutation; stale revisions are rejected after that unread gate. A closed Task rejects replies and new Attention; reopening restores the Task without restoring prior Attention. Taskless Threads still support replies, follow, mentions, Inbox, read, and history, but have no Claims or Task-resolution path. Top-level Messages may mention Agents directly: mentioned Members start following the new Thread. In an existing Thread, a Human reply mentioning an unfollowed Agent requires a process-local, one-use confirmation token before the operation commits, while such Member replies are rejected with member_not_following. Message facts carry their structured mention refs, and the Client renders mention chips only for those Members. Claim/done/release and Task changes are ordered host-authored Activities. Active Claims exclude only the same normalized Direction; different Directions can run concurrently. Task state is derived from Claims unless Human acceptance or closure overrides it. Close releases active Claims and clears Thread Attention atomically. Member removal marks the member inactive, releases owned active Claims, clears its Attention and direct markers, and archives the session after the durable commit. Message and Activity facts share one bounded sequence cursor.

`changes()` is the Client invalidation stream. Each request declares one optional `scope` — workspace, channel, or thread — plus an abortable transport signal; a committed operation wakes only waiters whose scope matches the scopes derived from that operation (member lifecycle and presence wake their Workspace; content operations wake their Channel and Thread). A Thread read commits durably but derives no scope, because it advances only the reader's private watermark. After each commit the Host notifies only the Members whose Inbox projection the operation can have changed — the operation's Attention/marker delta plus current followers of the touched Threads — never every live Agent.

M1 supports one Host writer. The ledger is permanent and has no snapshot or compaction path.

## Composition

The bundle consumes the Host's existing singleton providers; it does not mount replacements for `agents`, default model selection, `tools`, `fs`, `sandboxPolicy`, Session store/persistence, Workspace registry, or storage. Load those Host services once, then mount this Service and its invariant companion. The Team Web Client is the only Human control surface.

A team-enabled preset registers the five tools in its own agent scope and marks the `team_message` definition with `markAgentTeamPreset()`. Preset rows must resolve `ctx.agentTeam` when executing, not statically inject it: the Host mounts member presets while it restores Members during its own activation, so a row that declares `agentTeam` as a dependency cannot activate and fails every startup restore. Duplicate scoped tool names fail during unpublished setup and make only that Member unavailable. Duplicate Host service providers remain a composition error and should be removed rather than layered.

## Model Experience

### Host collaboration state

#### What the model sees

An enabled Member may receive one bounded, coalesced context notification after durable unread work appears. Structured direct mentions include their Message body and source; Task/Claim Activities include concise state transitions; ordinary unread includes only a Thread-first route, counts, and revisions, with a Task overlay where present. The notification is queued at the Agent's safe step boundary, so active model requests and tools are not interrupted. It routes the common path directly to `team_thread.read`; the model uses `team_inbox` only when it needs to triage remaining Threads.

#### Token effect

The ledger, projection, and Human status reads add no model tokens.

#### KV Cache effect

The Host ledger and Human status reads do not alter model requests or cache reuse.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Single Host writer** — concurrent processes over one dshHome are unsupported; operation serialization is process-local.
- **Permanent ledger** — M1 provides neither snapshots nor compaction, so storage grows with committed collaboration facts.
- **No remote provider seam** — the package combines the capability definition and its only implementation until a real remote Consumer requires another Provider.
- **Current DSH SQLite only** — SQLite Session persistence uses the current DSH schema. Delete old Session databases and create new Member sessions; this package provides no migration, compatibility read, or fallback.
