/**
 * The environment check decides one of exactly three shapes from three facts,
 * and this suite locks the boundaries that make those facts meaningful.
 *
 * The two version boundaries are the reason the verdict rides the Harness's own
 * `evaluatePluginCompatibility` instead of a comparison written here:
 * `0.1.7-alpha.1` sorts *below* `0.1.7-rc.1`, so a string comparison or a plain
 * `semver.satisfies` without prereleases would call a genuinely unsupported
 * line supported. `0.1.7-rc.2` sorting *inside* the same range is the other
 * half: the certified baseline advances without the peer range moving, which is
 * why the range's lower bound — not the newest cut — is what the page states.
