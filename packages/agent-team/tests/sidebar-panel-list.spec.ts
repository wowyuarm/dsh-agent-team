/**
 * The Team-mode rail standdown in the Client's `sidebar.module.css` hides the
 * shipped panel rail by DOM shape: a `nav` carrying the CSS-module `panelList`
 * class. That class name belongs to the Harness checkout, and `test:browser` —
 * the only lane that would notice a rename — never runs in CI, so the coupling
 * is pinned here against the shipped source.
