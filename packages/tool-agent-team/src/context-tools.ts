/**
 * Model-facing context-management tools for Team Members.
 *
 * `context_rollover` and `context_checkpoint` are the published engine's tools,
 * built by `createContinuityTools`: the engine owns their argument contract, the
 * anti-forgery gate on a cited ref, the `concludeTurn()` timing, and the render
 * shapes, while the Team supplies its own vocabulary (`TEAM_CONTINUITY_TEXT`)
 * and the mechanism behind `ContinuityToolAdapter`. Hand-written copies of those
 * two descriptions used to live here and drifted from the engine's defaults, so
 * the Team's guidance now travels only through the engine's text seams.
 *
 * `context_timeline` deliberately stays Team-owned. Its render never prints a
 * ref-shaped string for a non-restorable row — a short digest names the row
 * instead, because a printed ref is exactly what a model copies into
 * `checkpointRef` — and the engine's render has no switch for that. The
 * adapter's own `timeline` member is still implemented: the engine's contract
 * requires it, and the shape it returns is the one the engine's render reads.
 * @module @wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team/context-tools

Only the first delivery of a Thread\'s facts anchors; later re-deliveries and reminders produce no boundary. Returns approximate retained/discarded token estimates, current usage against the pressure budget, the Threads whose facts entered your context by each anchor, and which anchors are restorable. A Team boundary is a selectable default checkpoint exactly when the retained prefix through it stays inside one Thread and the return would shrink the working set below the handoff budget; a boundary spanning several Threads, or attributable to none, states its reason instead. Every row carries a short `anchor` id: it distinguishes rows that share a label and a price, and it is NOT a ref — only the `checkpointRef` printed on a restorable row may be cited to context_rollover. Structural only: no transcript content. A fresh context_rollover (no checkpointRef) never requires consulting this timeline first — call it directly. Use this tool only when you specifically intend a checkpointRef return: to pick the smallest sufficient ref, or to confirm that a fresh handoff is the better path when every anchor is marked non-restorable.',
