# Environments and installation

English | [中文](environments-and-install.zh.md)

## Sandbox and CI environments
The test and type systems are not self-contained: they resolve 40+ `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` packages from the adjacent Harness checkout (both `src/` and a built `lib/`). Sandboxed agents and CI runners must reproduce that layout instead of improvising their own.

This applies to any fresh environment: a new clone **or a `git worktree`**. A worktree does not carry the main checkout's gitignored `node_modules/` and `lib/`, so the setup below is required from scratch there too — skipping step 4 (linking and building) surfaces later as mass false preset-resolution failures in host tests, not as a missing-module error at startup.

**Checkout naming is the contract.** Clone the Harness as the sibling `../deepseek-harness` — the default directory name every script falls back to — and check out the latest certified release tag. Sibling checkouts with tag-suffixed names (`../deepseek-harness-<tag>/`) belong to isolated certification environments only (see [dsh-release-compatibility.md](../dsh-release-compatibility.md) §3.2); pointing tooling at one is the root cause of mass false test failures. A checkout with a non-default name must be selected explicitly with `DSH_HARNESS_DIR`.

**Setup, in order:**

1. Enable the corepack shims with `corepack enable pnpm`, then clone `../deepseek-harness`, check out the latest certified release tag (currently `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.1`; advance it per certification), and run `corepack pnpm install` (one workspace-wide install) followed by `corepack pnpm build:lib` and `corepack pnpm build:native-system`. The shim is required because the certified Harness invokes a bare `pnpm` from inside its own scripts (`build:lib`, `build:web`), while `corepack pnpm` resolves only within its own process; without the shim those steps fail as `pnpm: not found`.

   Both repositories pin `pnpm@11.7.0` through `packageManager`, so the shim resolves to that version rather than whatever the environment preinstalled. The native step is a separate build that nothing else performs for us: the host addon is gitignored, the Harness `test` script builds it itself via `build:native-system` before its own Vitest run, and this repository runs Vitest directly against that checkout — so a fresh clone without it fails host Team activation (`Agent is not an active Team Member`) rather than reporting a missing module.

   `--host-addon-only` exits without building off Linux/macOS, so the same step is safe on every platform. Do not reuse stale `lib/` or `node_modules/` from an earlier build — old artifacts can conceal declaration or runtime incompatibility.
2. Build the Harness `apps/web` dist with `corepack pnpm build:web` if the workflow needs `test:browser`; the workspace install already provisioned its dependencies.
3. Inside this repository, install with `corepack pnpm install`. Never run `npm install`: it silently breaks the workspace symlinks into the adjacent checkout's vendor packages, and the failure surfaces later as a misleading `Cannot find module 'zod'`.
4. Link the Harness workspace, its vendor packages, and — when the resolution is the sibling checkout — the context-continuity engine into this repository's `node_modules` with `node scripts/link-harness-packages.mjs`, then build the bundle with `npm run build`.

   The engine comes from wherever `scripts/continuity-dir.mjs` resolves it: a sibling `../dsh-context-continuity` checkout (development against an engine working tree, which must be built there first with `npm run build`) is linked into `node_modules`, while a clean checkout or CI uses the package the root `dependencies` installed from the registry and links nothing; `DSH_CONTEXT_CONTINUITY_DIR` points the resolution at another checkout.

   Host tests resolve preset rows and the bundle's own unpublished rows (for example `@wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team/member-context`) through real `node_modules` lookups from this repository root, exactly as a profile install of the published bundle would.
5. Regenerate the TypeScript path facades against the fresh checkout with `node scripts/sync-paths.mjs`. A fresh clone must not trust the committed facades: no npm script rewrites them, and skipping this step leaves them pointing at the paths baked in at generation time — the read-only `check:facades` gate that `npm test` runs fails on exactly that mismatch. `sync-paths` also emits the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-locale/src/*` wildcard the test harness's locale-table import needs.
6. Smoke-check with `npm run typecheck && npm test`. Green means the environment is right; mass false failures (see below) mean it is not — fix the environment before debugging the diff.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Required for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHROME_PATH` | `test:browser` (optional) | Defaults to `/usr/bin/google-chrome`; set only when the sandbox Chrome lives elsewhere |
| `DSH_CONTEXT_CONTINUITY_DIR` | isolated-checkout runs only | Points the engine resolution at another `dsh-context-continuity` checkout; unset for everyday work — the sibling checkout is preferred, then the installed package |
| `DSH_HARNESS_DIR` | certification escapes only | Points at a tag-suffixed sibling checkout; unset for everyday work — the default name is the contract |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | `npm run preview` | Real-model preview fails fast without it; test and browser paths never need it |

**Symptoms of a wrong environment, not wrong code:** mass `TypeError ... reading 'UNLOADING'` / `FiberState` undefined failures mean Vitest resolved a stale or missing Harness checkout; `Cannot find module 'zod'` means npm broke the pnpm links — unless it comes from `generate:typert`, which provisions its own link (see Generated files). Fix the environment before debugging the diff.

**No stray `node_modules` above the working tree.** TypeScript `typeRoots` and Node module resolution both walk ancestor directories, so a leftover `node_modules\@types` in a home directory (from an accidental `npm install` run there once) silently injects its types into every compile — observed as React-19-typed errors against a React-18 lockfile on the harness build. If a fresh checkout fails typecheck with type errors the lockfile cannot explain, check each ancestor directory for a stray `node_modules` before debugging the code.

**The checkout pointer is centralized and fails fast. ** `scripts/harness-dir.mjs` is the single source of truth every consumer (Vitest, `sync-paths`, `build-client`, `generate-typert`, the browser/preview runners) resolves through: `DSH_HARNESS_DIR` wins when set, then the `.generated-harness` marker that `sync-paths` writes (so tests follow the same checkout the facades were generated against — a forgotten env var after a cert-run generation cannot split them), then the default sibling name.

A resolved checkout that does not exist aborts immediately with the sibling Harness checkouts that do exist and pointers to the fix, instead of surfacing as the far-away symptoms above.

**The engine pointer resolves a checkout or the installed package. ** `scripts/continuity-dir.mjs` is the single source of truth for `@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity`: `DSH_CONTEXT_CONTINUITY_DIR` wins when set, then the sibling `dsh-context-continuity` checkout (development against an engine working tree — `link-harness-packages.mjs` links it into `node_modules` and `generate-typert.mjs` provisions it into its analysis package), then the package the root `dependencies` entry installed under `node_modules/@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity` (a clean checkout or CI — nothing to link there).

A resolution with no package layout aborts immediately with the candidates it tried and pointers to the fix.

**The engine's install contract. ** The engine is published as `@wowyuarm/dsh-context-continuity`; the root manifest declares it as a regular dependency — the profile install brings it in alongside the bundle: profiles run pnpm with `autoInstallPeers: false`, so a peer nothing else provides resolves for nobody, and the boot-critical closure gate in `shipping.spec.ts` counts dependencies among the reachable roots. CI therefore needs no engine step: `pnpm install` brings the prebuilt package in, and the link script skips a link that would point the package name at itself.

Advancing the engine means updating that one entry and committing `pnpm-lock.yaml`; a local run that resolves the sibling checkout must have that checkout built (`npm run build` there).

**CI lanes. ** [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs typecheck plus the full test suite on clean `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` runners — on pull requests, pushes to `master`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`. Both lanes execute the same six-step environment contract above; the Windows lane runs every step through git bash (`shell: bash`) because the default pwsh breaks backslash line continuations, and links the harness packages through directory junctions so no symlink privilege is needed.

Scope guard: no coverage matrix, no release automation, and no `test:browser` — browser acceptance stays a local step. The Windows lane is the regression fence for filesystem-identifier bugs (issues #7/#8). The only adjustable variable is `DSH_HARNESS_TAG`; when certification advances the tag, update the workflow env, this document, and [`.hoplite/settings.json`](../../.hoplite/settings.json) together — the three stay in sync by hand.

A tag advance that also moves the DSH peers must commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` in the same change: CI installs with `frozen-lockfile`, while a local install rewrites the lockfile in place and hides the mismatch until CI runs. The dev scripts (`build-client`, `run-browser-test`, `run-preview`, `run-ui-preview`) are Windows-hardened and run under git bash there, so local Windows development follows the same environment contract.

## External installation verification
The published layout is the root bundle:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team
dsh web
```

A local directory can be installed with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/to/dsh-agent-team
dsh web
```

`cordis.patch.yml` is the bundle patch entry point. It adds Host, Client, and invariant rows to the opt-in profile and mounts the `team-member` roster in the isolated `agentPresets` scope. Ordinary shipped/user preset rosters must not be changed.

Always verify the built publication layout. A source symlink can bypass profile peer fallback and differ from a real installation; the browser scripts copy built packages for this reason.

### Profiles and release cadence

Stable and development profiles are intentionally separate:

- **Stable (`--profile web`)** uses the npm release (`^0.1.x`), with the lockfile selecting the installed version. After a release, install the published version by exact number — `dsh plugin --profile web add @wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team@X.Y.Z` — because a plain `update` can report "Already up to date" while the lockfile still pins the old resolution. See [`release-runbook.md`](../release-runbook.md) §6.
- **Development (`--profile web-dev`)** uses a local `link:` checkout. Rebuild before restarting: the Host loads `packages/*/lib/`, so restarting without `npm run build` keeps old tools and behavior.

The runtime must match the installation form. Published `dsh` runs the stable profile from built artifacts; checkout `pnpm dsh` runs source through tsx and paths and should only start a linked profile. Mixing them can create two module instances whose scope Symbols differ and can produce `selected preset is not team-enabled`.

Release cadence is batched. Between releases, daily use of a local build is a lightweight acceptance channel; choose the narrowest check for each small change and batch a release after accumulated fixes are stable. The release procedure itself — pre-flight, the check ladder, release material, the tag and publish sequence, and post-publish verification — is [`release-runbook.md`](../release-runbook.md).

Stable and development profiles share `$DSH_HOME/storages/`. If a stable old version reads a ledger written by a newer version, schema validation can fail; update the stable profile after each release.

The minimum compatible DSH version is `0.1.7-rc.1`. DSH's JSONL Session persistence migrates released historical formats itself (v0/v1/v2 → V3 → V4); old-format Session data needs no manual disposal. Do not add Team ledger or Member Session migration, old-format reads, or silent fallbacks.

### Rewriting and pushing history

Local refs can be the only copy of what `master` does not contain: the `backup-pre-*` branches and the local-only tags that pin abandoned pre-rewrite commits are one such family, and deleting them is irreversible. Pushing them is irreversible in the other direction — this repository is public, and a published commit cannot be withdrawn.

Before rewriting history — `reset --hard` over committed work, `rebase`, or an amend that abandons commits with unique content — park the current tip in a `backup-pre-<what>-<YYYYMMDD>` branch, or in a `git bundle` file when the refs themselves are about to be deleted. Without one, `git reflog` is the only anchor for the abandoned commits and `git gc` prunes unreachable objects; the 2026-09-12 rewrite of the 0.1.11 round created no backup ref, so only the reflog held the replaced commits.

Before pushing, dry-run the exact refspec and require the output to name only the refs you intend to publish:

```sh
git push --dry-run origin master    # add the version tag when the push is a release
```

A third ref means a local-only ref would go public — stop and resolve it first. `git push --all` and `git push --tags` bypass this gate and are never the release command. A release push is this same fence with the version tag added; the sequence around it is in [`release-runbook.md`](../release-runbook.md) §5.
